		<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
		Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He was born to a Canadian mother, Maye Musk, and a South African father, Errol Musk. Musk lived in South Africa until 1989; when he was 17, he applied for a Canadian passport and moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, to avoid entering the South African military service. Before becoming one of the most famous entrepreneurs, he was an introverted child. From a young age, he showed great interest in computers and science; he learned computer programming alone by reading a manual. When he was only 12, he created a code for a video game that he sold for $500. Musk studied several careers; he graduated in 1995 with two Bachelor’s degrees — one in economics and another in physics, from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. That same year, he moved to California to pursue a business career. He took two internships in Silicon Valley before he started developing his own companies.<br>

Musk’s entrepreneurship journey is paved with successes. In 1995, using his father’s money ($28,000), he co-founded Zip2, a web software company. The start-up was sold that very same year for the sum of $307 million. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, today known as PayPal; the company was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion. The magnate has founded several successful companies and is the CEO of most of them. In 2002 he launched SpaceX, a company that manufactures and launches spacecraft. In 2004 he joined Tesla Motors, today Tesla, Inc; he became the company CEO in 2008. In 2015, Musk founded non-profit artificial intelligence research called OpenAI. And in 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a company that aims to combine the human brain with artificial intelligence.
